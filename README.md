# Hexagon

Hexagon is an ongoing private/replacement server project for the now-defunct game [Hexis](https://web.archive.org/web/20171120081249/http://hexis.dienay.net/). Hexis was a free-to-play rhythm game developed by Daniel (Dienay), drawing inspiration from both *[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)* and the Nintendo DS game *[Elite Beat Agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Beat_Agents)*. The project was discontinued indefinitely in 2017, and very little information about it remains today.

It is recommended to set up this project using the [hexagon-deploy](https://github.com/hexis-revival/hexagon-deploy) repository, and use the `env_run.sh` command for development purposes afterwards. Please note that this project is still in early development and far from complete, as reverse engineering is a very time-consuming process.
